<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Maxence Bessi</h1>

<p align="center">
My name is Maxence, Iâ€™m 19. I'm from La Seyne sur Mer, France. I started my development journey in August 2021 with Node.js, diving deep into the Discord universe and exploring how bots work. After a year of creating bots, I expanded my horizons by exploring HTML and CSS, although the visual aspect is not my strength. Persevering, I continued my learning by exploring C++ and Java. In order to host my services, I started using Docker and then Proxmox.
