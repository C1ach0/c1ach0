<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Maxence Bessi</h1>

<p align="center">
Hello, I am Maxence, a passionate developer based in La Seyne sur Mer, France, aged 19. My development journey started in August 2021 with growing expertise in Node.js. Fascinated by the Discord universe, I deepened my skills by creating bots, expanding my horizons to HTML, CSS, C++, and Java. Currently in training Application Developer Designer, I strive to acquire technological versatility. Also mastering Docker and Proxmox for hosting services, I am constantly looking to expand my skills. My commitment to continuous learning and my passion for development make me a professional always ready to take on new challenges.
