<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Maxence Bessi</h1>

<p align="center">
Hi, Iâ€™m Maxence, a passionate developer based in La Seyne sur Mer, France. My development journey began in August 2021, with growing expertise in Node.js. My fascination with the Discord universe led me to create bots, expanding my skills to HTML, CSS, C++, and Java. Currently in training as an Application Developer Designer, I strive to acquire technological versatility. With a mastery of Docker and Proxmox for hosting services, I am constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skills. My commitment to continuous learning and my passion for development make me a professional always ready to take on new challenges.
